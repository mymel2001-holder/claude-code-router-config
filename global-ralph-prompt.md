@plan.md @activity.md

First read activity.md to see what was recently accomplished.

Open plan.md and choose the single highest priority task where passes is false.

Work on exactly ONE task: implement the change.

After implementing, check your work by running the script for 60 seconds, quitting, and checking for errors.

If it's a web project, use Playwright to test the service as a user would.

Append a dated progress entry to activity.md describing what you changed.

Update that task's passes in plan.md from false to true.

Make one git commit for that task only with a clear message.

Do not git init, do not change remotes, do not push.

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.

When ALL tasks have passes true, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
