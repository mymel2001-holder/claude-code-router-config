# claude-code-router-config
My Claude Code Router config. (Along with some nifty extras.)

## NOTE

`mcp-claude-code.sh` MUST be run per-project, `global-ralph-prompt.md` must be copied per project (in project root),  `activity.md` must be created as an empty file in the project root, and `plan.md` must be written in the project root. However, the claude code router config only has to be implemented once, and "ralph" bash script may be ran from your home folder as long as the current directory has the three magic markdown files.
